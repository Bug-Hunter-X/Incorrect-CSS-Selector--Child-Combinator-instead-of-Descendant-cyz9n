This repository demonstrates a common error in CSS selectors. The bug.css file contains a faulty selector using the child combinator (>) when a descendant combinator (space) is needed. The bugSolution.css file provides the correct solution.  The problem is that the selector only matches elements directly within the specified parent, not any descendants. The solution uses the correct descendant combinator.
